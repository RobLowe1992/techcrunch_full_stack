# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**2.5: Performing / Excelling**
> The app contains several well-structured models, with at least 1 association, though includes several unnecessary models, some of which do not interact with the database. Five models have full CRUD.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. The app is a well done and effective mock-up of TechCrunch's website.

## Code Quality
**1.5: Progressing/Performing**
> Virtually all controller code was scaffolded, generating a lot of unnecessary or repetitive code/models.

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
> Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**0: Incomplete**
> No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, etc)
