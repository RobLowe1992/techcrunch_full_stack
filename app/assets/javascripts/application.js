At the time, they didn’t say exactly when it’d launch — just that it’d be “soon.”</p><p>“Soon,” it seems, means today. YouTube is rolling out the service in five major US cities this morning.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tv.youtube.com">YouTube TV</a> takes a bunch of the more popular U.S. cable channels — ABC, Fox, CBS, NBC, CW, Disney, SyFy, ESPN and 40+ more — and crams them into one app. It’ll cost $35 a month, and you’ll be able to stream to six devices simultaneously with each plan.</p><p>Alas, working around the existing monolith that is the cable industry takes a while… so YouTube TV will roll out in different regions over time, starting with today’s launch in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.</p><hr><p>Google sent me a pre-release build of the YouTube TV app, and I spent a bit of time with it prior to launch. Not enough for a full review, but enough for a few thoughts.</p><p>The app is well-designed and intuitive. It’s composed of just three tabs: Home, Library and Live. Home is your standard “stuff we think you should watch” page, Library is where you’ll find movies and shows you’ve saved (more on that in a second) and Live is a big ol’ list of everything currently playing on every channel YouTube TV currently offers up.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1472956" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot_20170404-235541.png?w=383&amp;h=680" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot_20170404-235541.png?w=383&amp;h=680 383w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot_20170404-235541.png?w=766&amp;h=1360 766w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot_20170404-235541.png?w=84&amp;h=150 84w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screenshot_20170404-235541.png?w=169&amp;h=300 169w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px"></p><p>This Live interface is particularly slick; as you scroll, a preview of each channel’s live feed slides into place at the top almost instantly. It feels a lot like flipping channels to see what’s on the ol’ cable box — a concept that, in this age of picking and choosing anything you want to watch on demand, seems to be fading away. As someone who dropped his cable subscription half a decade ago, I forgot how natural it feels to just turn on some channel and let it babble in the background. I also forgot how absolutely horrible daytime TV is.</p><div><div id="adsDivdbfcf60deb" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>After a few frame-rate hiccups that YouTube was able to patch away, the video quality was quite solid. Even fast-moving sports and action flicks look pretty darn good.</p><p>Don’t want to watch TV on your phone or tablet all the time? As you’d expect from a Google-built video app, it’s got Chromecast support — and like everything that has Chromecast, it’s super simple. Tap the Chromecast icon, pick which TV you want the video on and you’re set.</p><p>There’s a built-in “unlimited DVR” feature that lets you tap any show to record any and all future instances of it. It’s a nice touch for sports or shows that aren’t on Hulu/etc. (or those that make Hulu/etc. wait a week after airing) — but beyond those scenarios, if I’m going to be planning ahead to watch something after it’s live, I’m probably turning somewhere else for it.</p><p>(One curious bit in an otherwise straightforward design: If you want to browse a specific channel’s shows, you first tap into the search bar. It’s not the first place I thought to look, but it works.)</p><p>So, should you sign up?</p><p>If you’re one of those people who ditched cable TV&nbsp;long ago for Netflix/Hulu/etc. and haven’t looked back, you might not be missing much here.</p><p>If, however, you’re staying tied to your monthly cable bill for the sake of catching things live every once in a while (news/sports/etc.) <em>and</em> YouTube TV is available in your area <em>and</em> it’s got the channels you watch, it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://tv.youtube.com">worth a look</a>. The first month is free, and if you pay for a month beyond that, they’ll throw in a Chromecast… which, with an MSRP of $35, makes that second month kinda-sorta free too.</p><p>The app should roll out for both iOS and Android today.</p></div>',

The FTC’s original <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/07/ftc-alleges-amazon-unlawfully-billed-parents-millions-dollars">complaint</a> said that Amazon should be liable for millions of dollars it charged customers, because of the way its Appstore software was designed – that is, it allowed kids to spend unlimited amounts of money in games and other apps without requiring parental consent.</p><p>The&nbsp;FTC had previously settled with both <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/apple-settles-with-ftc-over-app-store-in-app-purchases-to-avoid-distracting-legal-fight/">Apple</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/12/ftc-approves-final-order-case-about-google-billing-kids-app">Google</a> on similar charges, before turning its sights to Amazon.</p><p>The issue had to do with the way the Amazon Appstore’s in-app purchasing system worked. The Amazon&nbsp;Appstore is the store that comes preloaded on Amazon mobile devices, like Kindle Fire tablets, for example, though there is a way to load it onto other Android devices, too.</p><p>Of course,&nbsp;many kids’ game developers notoriously try to blur the lines between what’s free and paid. They also often design games in a way that they only fully function&nbsp;when kids use&nbsp;in-game items, which can be sometimes earned through gameplay or other times purchased through the app itself. Kids are pushed to buy these things regularly – as any parent can tell you, having experienced their kids’ begging for these items.</p><p>But in Amazon’s Appstore, which launched back in 2011, the company didn’t originally require passwords on in-app purchases. This allowed kids to buy coins and other items to their hearts’ content. One particularly awful example involved a game called “Ice Age Village” that offered an in-app purchase of $99.99.</p><p>Amazon introduced password-protected in-app purchases in March 2012, but then only on those where the purchase exceeded $20. In early 2013, it updated the system again to require passwords, but also allowed a 15-minute window afterwards where no password was required. The FTC said Amazon didn’t obtain “informed consent” until July 2014.</p><div><div id="adsDiv88c02c8d53" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>To make matters worse, parents complaining weren’t told how to get a refund and Amazon had even suggested at times that refunds weren’t possible, the FTC’s complaint had said.</p><p>Amazon and the FTC have now agreed to end appeals related to the earlier ruling, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/07/ftc-alleges-amazon-unlawfully-billed-parents-millions-dollars">the FTC announced on Tuesday, April 4.</a> Another issue that had come into play was the FTC’s request for an injunction to forbid Amazon from similar conduct in the future. The court denied that injunction, the FTC appealed, and Amazon cross-appealed the ruling that said Amazon had violated the law.</p><p>Now the two parties have agreed to end their litigation and begin the refund process.</p><p>More than $70 million in in-app charges made between November 2011 and May 2016 may be eligible for refunds, the FTC notes. It’s not likely that all affected customers will take the time to make their requests, however.</p><p>Amazon has not yet announced how the refund program will operate or when it launches but these details are to come shortly, says the FTC.</p></div>',

How many funds are you involved with?</strong></p><p>MK: We have 15 “core” relations, where we’ve invested $8 million to $10 million, then we have a pilot program where we invest $1 million in 8 or 9 groups that we like but we have some lingering questions about their strategy. For example,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a> in Boston and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.muckercapital.com/">Mucker Capital</a> in L.A. were part of our pilot program because we didn’t have a high conviction about either the Boston or L.A. ecosystems. Now we do, so they’ve become core.</p><p>The hardware investment firms <a target="_blank" href="http://bolt.io/">Bolt</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.root.vc/">Root Ventures</a> also became part of that pilot program, because we had questions about whether seed was the right entry point for hardware investing.</p><p><strong>TC: Which is the newest fund to join your pilot portfolio?</strong></p><p>MK: <a target="_blank" href="http://notationcapital.com/">Notation Capital</a> in Brooklyn.</p><p><strong>TC: Do all “pilots” become “core”?</strong></p><p>MK: No. And we’ve ended up not continuing with some core funds as&nbsp;some have evolved from seed-stage to Series A-stage funds, and backing them is not the mandate our LPs gave us, notwithstanding how amazingly they’ve performed for us. I won’t share publicly which those are, though.</p><p><strong>TC: Where do you draw the line? So many of your&nbsp;managers are now investing two or three times the amount of their debut funds.</strong></p><p>MK: We’re SoftTech’s biggest LP. And SoftTech could have easily raised a $150 million vehicle (when it was <a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/softtech-vc-closes-its-fifth-fund-with-100-million-raises-50-million-opportunity-fund/">last out fundraising</a>). But it realized a seed found should be no larger than $100 million so raised a $100 million seed fund and a separate $50 million opportunity fund. We’re investors in the $100 million piece&nbsp;alone.</p><p><strong>TC: So as far as you’re concerned, a fund can’t do seed well with more than $100 million under management. What about ownership stakes? Do you have a strong feeling about how much a manager should own of each company?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>MK: We look for those who lead deals. We think ownership is paramount. We want our fund managers to focus on at least 15 percent ownership. So with the average seed fund going from $1 million to $3 million in recent years, to lead that round, you need to write a check for $1.5 million. That’s why these seed funds have gotten bigger.</p><div><div id="adsDivdbfcf60deb" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p><strong>TC: Do you care how many people are managing money at these seed firms? You see some that have several partners; you have others, like K9 Ventures, that’s run by a solo general partner, Manu Kumar.</strong></p><p>MK: We look at it as capital per partner. Lerer Hippeau has four people investing $113 million, so that’s $28 million per partner. We think the ideal range is $25 million to $35 million per partner.</p><p><strong>TC: There are <em>so</em> many seed fund investors. How many groups do you think you’ve met with altogether, and do you ever fund firms outside of the U.S.?</strong></p><p>MK: Since inception, we’ve&nbsp;talked with around 700 firms, either in person or over the phone.</p><p>We haven’t invested internationally. We felt that the ecosystems outside the U.S. were substantially weaker, owing to the lack of available follow-on capital. That was a huge concern in Europe, where for a long time it was basically Accel and Balderton and Index. &nbsp;But now there’s <a target="_blank" href="http://blueyard.com/">BlueYard Capital</a> in Berlin and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.felixcap.com/">Felix Capital</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mosaicventures.com/">Mosaic Ventures</a> in London. There’s a lot more going on, so we think the&nbsp;ecosystem has gotten better.</p><p><strong>TC: You make direct investments in certain companies when you can. For example, you were able to get equity in Dollar Shave Club through Forerunner Ventures, which also provided an introduction to the company&nbsp;when you asked for one. How do these things come together? How do you choose which companies to pursue with so many startups in your managers’ portfolios?</strong></p><p>MK: We have a monthly call with fund managers, but we’re&nbsp;also&nbsp;always trading calls or IMing because we have a pretty close relationship with them. And&nbsp;if a&nbsp;fund manager talks about a certain company and keeps mentioning it every month and it becomes clear that it’s tracking well, we’ll ask for an intro to its management team.</p><p><strong>TC: Does that ever create a conflict for your fund managers?</strong></p><p>MK: We only invest if the fund manager is coming into the same round, and usually they are stretching their reserves to do that; they can’t do full pro rata, which creates an opportunity for us to try and get in.</p><p>These are usually very attractive opportunities; we’ve had to fight to get into most of these. But I do think the opportunity set is increasing as these companies bubble up to the Series A and B stages.</p><p><strong>TC: Any thoughts on secondary sales and whether seed funds should hang on for the long haul if they have a buzzy company in their portfolio?</strong></p><p>MK: There’s definitely an opportunity for managers&nbsp;to sell into these higher-priced rounds. Our advice is if you have a 10x return, consider selling 10 to 20 percent and getting liquidity to investors. And we’ve seen a lot more of that over the last 12 to 24 months.</p><p>Seed funds can become hostages in high-valuation companies otherwise. Say the company ends up raising $100 million at a $2 billion valuation. Well, the seed would have been happy to sell, but now the new investor wants 3x from there, so this company has to get to a&nbsp;$6 billion valuation, and a lot of bad things can happen in pursuit of that.</p><p><strong>TC: Do you sell before the big exit? I’m&nbsp;guessing you don’t need to worry about so-called signaling risk — or do you?</strong></p><p>MK: We really don’t. We could sell into the next round and no one would blink an eye. It’s a negative signal if Sequoia does it. If Cendana does it, no one cares.</p></div>',

Google, however, says, those networks only account for about 5 percent of its own data center workload while the majority of its applications use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">multi-layer perceptrons</a>.</p><p>Google says it started looking into how it could use GPUs, FPGAs and custom ASICS (which is&nbsp;essentially what the TPUs are) in its data centers back in 2006. At the time, though, there weren’t all that many applications that could really benefit from this special hardware because most of the heavy workloads they required could just&nbsp;make use of the excess hardware that was already available in the data center anyway. “The conversation changed in 2013 when we projected that DNNs could become so popular that they might double computation demands on our data centers, which would be very expensive to satisfy with conventional CPUs,” the authors of Google’s paper write. “Thus, we started a high-priority project to quickly produce a custom ASIC for inference (and bought off-the-shelf GPUs for training).” The goal here, Google’s researchers say, “was to improve cost-performance by 10x over GPUs.”</p><div><div id="adsDiv88c02c8d53" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>Google isn’t likely to&nbsp;make the TPUs available outside of its own cloud, but the company notes that it expects that others will take what it has learned and “build successors that will raise the bar even higher.”</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473240" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=1024&amp;h=422" alt="" width="1024" height="422" srcset="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=1024&amp;h=422 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=300&amp;h=124 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=768&amp;h=316 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png?w=680&amp;h=280 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/2017-04-05_1011.png 1325w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>',

As part of that move, it’s <a target="_blank" href="http://axon.com/offer">offering free body cameras</a> and software to any police department that asks. Yes, free as in beer, and yes, any as in any.</p><p>I talked with the company’s founder, Rick Smith, about this major change and the shifts in policing and technology that prompted it.</p><p>“We started the company in a garage 23 years ago in an effort to make the bullet obsolete,” he said. “But the power of the Taser brand is focused on one thing. Now we do all this stuff with cameras. There’s nostalgia, there was a lot of internal resistance. But ultimately organizations have to change.”</p><p>The Taser brand will remain for the stun guns we all know, but the parent company will now be Axon, with the ticker symbol AAXN.</p><p>Axon, you may remember, was the division Taser created a few years ago to focus on the wearable camera space; the tech was getting there, and Taser was in the right position to bring it to law enforcement. It’s been a major success, but considering the benefits of deployment (some obvious, some disputed), uptake hasn’t been as fast as pretty much anyone would like. Right now around 20 percent of police have access to body cameras.</p><p>“It’s really just inertia,” Smith said. Regulatory holdups, budget limitations, and just plain skepticism have slowed things down. So Axon’s solution is to just straight-up give the product away. At least, for a limited time.</p><p>The deal is pretty simple: ask and ye shall receive an Axon Body 2 camera for every officer, the software and infrastructure to handle all the footage, and online training in how to use it. Everything is free with no obligations for a year.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472905" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=735" alt="" width="1024" height="735" srcset="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=735 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=150&amp;h=108 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=300&amp;h=215 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=768&amp;h=551 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg?w=680&amp;h=488 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/taser_axon_body.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a>“At the end of the year, they can return the stuff and never pay us a dime,” Smith said. “We thought it was win-win.”</p><p>Skeptical they can handle demand? The company has “tens of thousands of cameras on the shelves,” he noted. “We’ve been planning this for a while — we added a lot of support staff last year.”</p><p>Now, it hardly need be mentioned that this isn’t being done out of the goodness of Axon’s corporate heart. The company stands to profit immensely by being the de facto default for police camera systems. And it’s worth mentioning that the free offer makes it difficult for departments to resist, and once the benefits are public, it’s going to be even more difficult to give up.</p><p>But while in some situations I would characterize this as a sort of Trojan horse, it’s my opinion (and clearly Smith’s) that body cameras are probably the single most beneficial step we can take today to improve the quality of policing.</p><div><div id="adsDivdbfcf60deb" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472907" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=720" alt="" width="1024" height="720" srcset="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=720 1024w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=768&amp;h=540 768w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg?w=680&amp;h=478 680w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/axon-26.jpg 1729w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p>Not only do body cameras provide invaluable documentation of every interaction, they save a ton of time and money.</p><p>“Cops spend two-thirds of their time as a data entry clerk,” Smith said. “And when it comes down to it, no one trusts those reports anyway! We have much better information coming from the camera. It contains everything you would put in the report.”</p><p>“We believe we can cut that bureaucratic load, and if we can do that, we’ll effectively triple the world’s police force.”</p><p></p><div class="aside aside-related-articles"><h2>Related Articles</h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/police-complaints-drop-93-percent-after-deploying-body-cameras/">Police complaints drop 93 percent after deploying body cameras</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/study-finds-that-police-body-cameras-may-increase-assaults-if-used-improperly/">Study finds that police body cameras may increase assaults -- if used improperly</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/beyond-the-bullet/">Beyond the bullet</a></div>Big talk, but at least he’s putting his money where his mouth is. The program will be costly to Axon at first, but I can’t picture it playing out any way but positive in the long run. And in the meantime, a whole lot of police departments are going to get the tech they deserve but that tight budgets meant they weren’t going to get for years. If the cost for that is that a single company dominates the field for now, I think that’s a reasonable trade-off.<p></p><p>Of course, in order to replace reports, Axon’s software has to get a lot more sophisticated. Right now body cameras are sort of backup evidence, while laboriously filled out reports are still the standard. But the plan is to automate the extraction of information from the video to expedite things.</p><p>For example, the system could automatically transcribe any speech in the video and tag events with GPS and other stats. So when the officer wants to check what a person said during a traffic stop, they don’t have to scrub through 2 hours of video — they can just search for an interaction, or the license plate. AI systems could also intelligently redact videos, blurring out the faces of bystanders so that the video can be released publicly or presented in court.</p><p>That kind of data digging can get really creepy real fast, and Smith was quick to downplay the idea that Axon would be poring through millions of hours of footage assembling a kind of meta-surveillance database.</p><p>“We’re forming an AI ethics board with experts from outside the company,” he said. “It’s important we’re building the tech with the right considerations.”</p><p>It should be a big year for the newly renamed company, and let’s hope it’s equally big for the police departments it’s aiming to equip.</p></div>',

Bus.com is the destination you’d expect to head to for what the company does, which is organize charter bus trips for festivals, sporting events and shows by teaming up with bus companies with unused inventory.</p><p>The Bus.com model includes online rental, GPS tracking of buses so passengers know exactly when they’re arriving, and online ticketing. The founding team, which was a Y Combinator Winter 2016 class graduate, saw an opportunity to update the process of chartering buses for mass transit to one-off events and occasions, including festivals like the Way Home music festival north of Toronto, in Canada, and Sasquatch.</p><p>Perviously, charter bus services for this market, which accounts for around $4 billion in annual revenue according to Bus.com, has relied heavily on a network of small operators with around 10 or fewer buses each. These charter operators had no common standards or platform in terms of pricing, service or booking process, leading to a lot of confusion and complexity on the user end of the process, and also for festival operators.</p><p>Bus.com co-founder Wolf Kohlberg has “only ever worked in booking, planning and travel execution,” explains his partner and the startup’s CEO&nbsp;Kyle Boulay&nbsp;on a phone call. Kohlberg started and ran a successful bus booking company to provide transit to soccer games in his home country of Germany before moving around and landing in Quebec, where he was working for a travel agency and noticed that a lot of small bus companies had a lot of unused inventory, but were lacking basic organizational tools including things like websites. He teamed up with web developer and designer Boulay to create a tool to take advantage of this opportunity, which was growing thanks to dwindling individual ownership of cars, paired with a tendency for events to be located just outside cities and urban centers.</p><div><div id="adsDiv88c02c8d53" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>The team created a basic software platform that brought together a lot of the missing elements in one place, and have been iterating on it very since. Their focus is increasingly on making sure festival and event organizers can more easily offer charter travel as an integrated component of what they provide their customers.</p><p>“All that software is actually very much in need in the charter bus industry, and not just around renting per seat, but renting buses in general, and helping turn event producers into smart travel planners for their attendees and for their guests,” Boulay&nbsp;explained. “The rebrand from Sharethebus to Bus.com better positions us as a more holistic solution for the industry in general and the population at large.”</p><p>I asked Lastovskiy if he believes an investment from BMW, even if through their venture organization specifically, indicates any larger interest among automakers in the charter space as a mobility service opportunity. He said he couldn’t speculate as to the car industry’s interest in that area, but it’s an interesting partner nonetheless given recent explorations into unique transportation models by car companies in general.</p></div>',

It’s the first time that Uber has acknowledged that any of Waymo’s documents are in the possession of any Uber employees. However, Uber emphasized that the document was not found on Uber’s computers. “We did collect documents from him and thus far we have only found one document from his computers that matches the documents identified in the complaint,” Gonzalez said.</p><p>Waymo claims that Kshirsagar downloaded several confidential documents in June 2016, one month before resigning and joining Anthony Levandowski at Uber. The names of the five specific documents are partially redacted in court filings, but one references “laser questions” and another “lens placement.”</p><p>Levandowski is one of three Uber employees accused of taking Waymo trade secrets, and Waymo says he took 14,000 documents, while Kshirsagar and&nbsp;Radu Raduta took only a few. Waymo is now asking for Uber to turn over those stolen documents as part of the discovery process in its trade secret lawsuit against its competitor, while Uber argues that it cannot&nbsp;hand over anything from Levandowski without violating his Fifth Amendment rights and that it has already thoroughly searched for the documents at Uber.</p><p>Uber said it has interviewed 85 current and former employees, 42 of whom worked in the automotive division. Uber searched 10 of the employees’ computers and looked through the company’s git repository for files that matched Waymo’s descriptions. The company found 31,000 hits but described them as “not substantive.”</p><div><div id="adsDivdbfcf60deb" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>“I&nbsp;believe that we will demonstrate to you that those 14,000 files never made it to Uber,” Gonzalez said.</p><p>Waymo claimed in a letter to the court that Uber did not meet the deadline to hand over documents and refused to provide all of the documents Waymo had requested, particularly the 14,000 confidential Waymo documents Levandowski allegedly downloaded before he left the company to lead Uber’s self-driving car unit.</p><p>“To the extent Uber tries to excuse its noncompliance on the grounds that Mr. Levandowski has invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to provide Uber with documents or assistance, Waymo notes that Mr. Levandowski remains — <em><strong>to this day</strong></em> — an Uber executive and in charge of its self-driving car program. Uber has ratified Mr. Levandowski’s behavior and is liable for it,” Waymo attorney&nbsp;Charles K. Verhoeven wrote in a letter to the court (emphasis his).</p><p>Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the case, ordered Uber to search more thoroughly for the documents. He told Uber to search using 15 terms provided by Waymo, first on the employees’ computers that had already been searched, then on 10 employees’ computers selected by Waymo, and then on all other servers and devices connected to employees who work on Uber’s LiDAR system.</p><small>Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</small></div>',

Voyage wants to put self-driving cars on the road as part of a fleet of taxis, created using retrofits to existing vehicles that add autonomous capabilities without requiring ground-up vehicle creation.</p><p>The task Voyage sets for itself is nonetheless incredibly ambitious: The company wants to operate its own self-driving service entirely, including creating the ride hailing platform through which&nbsp;it’ll operate, and providing a unique product that relies heavily on voice input from the driver to get the ride going, control music and make stops, reports<a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/voyage-autonomous-taxi-udacity-2017-4"> Business Insider</a>. Voyage sees its customers as “drivers” in the sense that they’re in control of the in-vehicle experience, even if the vehicle is driving itself.</p><p>Voyage wants to get its cars working in a commercial capacity sooner, rather than later. The startup is looking at fielding vehicles “very soon,” according to the Insider report, and has already secured permission to start operating test vehicles with passenger trials sometime in the next few months, though it’s not discussing specific spots just yet.</p><p>Voyage will enter a busy space with tough competitors, including Uber and Ford, who have a lot of road experience already under their belts. The company also isn’t taking any of the tech developed by Udacity students via its self-driving program with it, according to Udacity, and Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun said that he’s keeping his distance from any of Voyage’s activities because of conflicts related to his prior role at Google’s self-driving car program.</p><div><div id="adsDiv88c02c8d53" class="native-ad-mobile"></div></div><p>Udacity provided the following statement regarding Voyage’s debut via a spokesperson:</p><p><em>Our Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program has seen strong demand with over 6,600 students enrolled worldwide and 24 hiring partners including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi among others. We are thrilled to have built a program of this calibre and have the ability to spin off a company in the self-driving space — there is no better testimony for the program. We look forward to watching Voyage grow in this exciting space.</em></p></div>',
